completed the Udemy course 'MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux, Node.js'

## description

This is a robust mock social media application that uses Redux with React hooks to manage a complicated state.  A user creates
an account that houses a profile about the user's education, skills, experience and links to other social media accounts.  The user can 
connect with other developers and engage in discussions by posting and commenting.  The github API is used to display the last 5 repos of the user.  Security is acheived with bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken and all personal information is protected in private routes.
